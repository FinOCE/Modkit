# Reporting Security Issues

[issue]: /issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Modkit, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please contact the project team privately in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SFX3fJZ4NA) for anything dangerous, otherwise issues can be posted public on [Github][issue].
